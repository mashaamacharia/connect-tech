              If you have ever been a part of a too-long, pointless meeting that led to no good results, you would agree
              that meetings are just as likely to be a time-wasting activity as it is to be a healthy, productive
              session focused on a certain goal. A recent Harvard Business Review survey confirmed that 71% of senior
              associates or managers consider meetings unproductive and inefficient. Besides this, 65% of them also said
              that meetings keep them away from completing their individual tasks on time.
            </p>

            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Indeed, meetings are an integral part of doing business. Since the onset of the pandemic, they have taken
              the form of remote team meetings and continue to exist nowadays. If you, being an employer or senior
              executive, feel there's something wrong with the way meetings are conducted, it's time to make amends or
              improvements. Ultimately, you would expect remote team meetings to improve productivity at work.
            </p>

            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Before we move to the actionable part of tips and tricks to be followed, let's uncover various types of
              remote team meetings first.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Classification of Remote Team Meetings</h2>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Let's start with the types of remote team meetings that can give you the most bang for your buck –
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Onboarding meetings</h3>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              When you have new hires in the team, those individuals need to learn a lot to become go-to players in
              their respective teams. This is where onboarding meetings come to the rescue and facilitate the beginning
              of required training. These meetings help the new joiners in understanding the company's structure,
              upcoming projects, their individual roles and responsibilities, and most importantly, set early-stage
              expectations.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Kickoff meetings</h3>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              These types of remote team meetings become a great place to fill your team members and let them know about
              a new initiative or project. Most of these meetings are effective by nature as people need to get along
              actively with the project goals to align their work schedules accordingly. Particularly, their individual
              buy-in is quite important to succeed along the lines of the project.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Brainstorming meetings</h3>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Almost every business runs and is eager to accept new ideas. Brainstorming meetings are the ones that keep
              the river of ideas flowing constantly. They can be designed to generate multiple ideas in a short period
              and are critical in solving a problem or achieving a specific goal.
            </p>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              A key aspect of these types of remote team meetings is that they are more focused on the ideas and not the
              outcome.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Feedback meetings</h3>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Learning from experience is good for every professional irrespective of his niche or expertise. To make
              your team learn from a project or activity, feedback meetings are just as important as kickoff
              alternatives. They provide you with the opportunity to talk about what went well and what could be
              improved further.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Financial or budget meetings</h3>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              In every business including yours, there can be significant communication around money, which makes
              financial meetings a crucial part of the rotation. They are more about figuring out how much to pay or
              earn, who is going to pay, and when.
            </p>

            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Now that we have a brief glance at different types of remote team meetings, let's unravel what's there for
              improving the outcome of these meetings.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
              How to Prepare For, Hold, and Improve Remote Team Meetings?
            </h2>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">1. Pick the right meeting tools</h3>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              If you look at the core structure and functioning of remote meetings, most of them are based on the
              balance between three parameters: collaboration, connection, and feedback. Reduce the proportion of any of
              these parameters and you will most likely feel bad about the meeting.
            </p>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              For example – if the meeting attendees only listen to what is being said without sharing any inputs or
              asking for any feedback, the experience will suffer.
            </p>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              This is where having the right meeting tools in your arsenal is quite important. In the list of your
              tools, here're a few must-haves to ensure proper team engagement:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li className=" font-light text-gray-700">
                Zoom, Skype, or Microsoft Teams for better connection
              </li>
              <li className=" font-light text-gray-700">Slack or Google Slides for improved collaboration</li>
              <li className=" font-light text-gray-700">Google Forms for collecting feedback</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">2. Have a focused meeting agenda</h3>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Remote team meetings take effort and time from all the participants. Hence, it makes sense that these
              resources are best utilized by setting a direction for the meeting in the form of a pre-decided agenda. If
              you usually go about calling various stakeholders into a meeting room and then create the agenda, the
              chances are it will take more time, or in other words, waste more time and resources.
            </p>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Instead, create a detailed plan for items – tasks at hand, next quarter goals, or current roadblocks if
              any, that you want to cover and push the participants to ask questions or share feedback. Once you have
              covered all the items in the agenda, you can conclude it for maximum meeting productivity.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">3. Set a convenient meeting time</h3>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              When you are scheduling a remote team meeting, you need to keep a check on the priorities of the team
              members. For instance, if you want to talk to the customer support team, you need to prioritize their
              work-specific timings when the clients they deal with are least active. Similarly, if your team is located
              globally and falls into different time zones, you need to consider the time that is suitable for every
              participant.
            </p>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              To make things more specific, you can set a meeting duration and ensure that it ends within the given time
              limits. Another crucial aspect here is to send the meeting notification to the team way before the time
              when it is scheduled. This will allow the members to manage the work accordingly.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              4. Plan to include ice-breakers as a part of the meeting
            </h3>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              While promoting remote work culture, you would also agree that it creates both emotional and physical
              distance between employees. With similar faces joining the video call for remote team meetings, you may
              not expect them to engage in every side of the meeting right away. Rather, it is your responsibility to
              break the ice and make them feel engaged in the conversation or agenda of the meeting.
            </p>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              While there are dozens of ideas for ice-breaking activities, your organizational culture may pose certain
              restrictions. However, you can choose from some of the favorites given below:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li className=" font-light text-gray-700">Quiz time on a topic related to the meeting agenda</li>
              <li className=" font-light text-gray-700">Team photo via video platform</li>
              <li className=" font-light text-gray-700">
                Remote coffee time when everyone on the team enjoys tea or coffee together
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">5. Set the mood for the meeting first</h3>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Your team members' mood has a significant impact on how they behave and feel while connected remotely via
              connection platforms. If you are the meeting host, focus on setting the meeting tone and mood to help the
              joiners gather their energy and be in a positive mood full of creative ideas.
            </p>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              If you feel the team members are stressed about the challenges at hand or the volume of work, ask for
              solutions upfront and make informed decisions. Let others feel like being true members by making their
              voices heard. This is how you can keep the spirit alive during the meeting period.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              6. Remind the attendees of the meeting goal visually
            </h3>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Has it ever happened to you that the remote team meeting you were a part of went totally off track and for
              no good reason?
            </p>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              This would be inevitable if the meeting attendees have no direction to lead the conversation. This is why
              it is important to remind the participants about the meeting objectives and gather their attention
              visually. This can be done with the help of presentations, whiteboards, and mind maps that will also make
              the conversations more engaging.
            </p>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              You can even create a slide or page that outlines the flow of the meeting, which can be like this:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li className=" font-light text-gray-700">Objective sharing</li>
              <li className=" font-light text-gray-700">Brainstorming</li>
              <li className=" font-light text-gray-700">Conclusion</li>
              <li className=" font-light text-gray-700">Q&A</li>
              <li className=" font-light text-gray-700">Ice-breaker</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              7. Split roles and allocate time to each team member
            </h3>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              For an effective remote team meeting, it is crucial to keep track of multiple things, be it keeping the
              employees engaged, making notes, or handling the presentation. In some cases, doing it all on your own
              often becomes impossible. This is where role split helps a lot.
            </p>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Whenever you hold a meeting, you can assign specific roles to different team members, such as:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li className=" font-light text-gray-700">
                Facilitator who is responsible to guide the attendants toward maintaining the meeting flow
              </li>
              <li className=" font-light text-gray-700">
                Notetaker who records key ideas, and results, and then shares minutes of the meeting
              </li>
              <li className=" font-light text-gray-700">
                Timekeeper who ensures that every section of the meeting receives adequate time and attention
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              8. Keep it engaging and better than before
            </h3>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              What happens after the to-the-point remote meetings that are not more than 5 minutes long? What about
              one-sided meetings where only one person is allowed to talk?
            </p>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              When meetings lack engagement, they ultimately become boring. Along with setting the tone and including
              ice-breakers, you can further improve upon the engagement quotient in the following ways:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li className=" font-light text-gray-700">
                Set the right expectations in terms of team engagement
              </li>
              <li className=" font-light text-gray-700">Add short activities for team building</li>
              <li className=" font-light text-gray-700">Celebrate the achievements of different team members</li>
              <li className=" font-light text-gray-700">
                Use quizzes to introduce various attendants to the agenda
              </li>
              <li className=" font-light text-gray-700">Run opinion polls</li>
            </ul>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              The key here is to make the meetings more engaging than the last ones.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">9. Record meetings if needed</h3>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              In meetings that are held for more than an hour, often the attendees realize they are missing out on some
              finer details. With the availability of the 'record meetings' feature in most communication platforms, you
              can sort out this aspect. After the meeting is over, you can share the recorded meeting URL or video link
              with every attendee. This way, whoever needs to revisit any section of the meeting can do so at their
              convenience.
            </p>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Recorded meeting clips also act as a reliable source of truth about what was discussed in the meeting.
              This further helps minimize the conflicts that may arise later.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">
              10. Ask attendees for post-meeting contribution
            </h3>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              The role of different members attending remote team meetings does not end when the meeting ends. Other
              than the work that is to be done to achieve different business-specific goals, you must remind the
              employees about participating in the post-meeting result in different ways. For example, you can ask the
              marketing team to take polls in order to get a certain website feature developed by the product team.
            </p>
            <p className=" font-light text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Asking for their feedback is yet another way to learn from the perspective of your team members.
